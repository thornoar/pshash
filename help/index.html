    <h2>Help information</h2>

    The work of the pshash pseudo-hash function is pictured here:

    <p>
    <IMG SRC="../documentation/figures/hash.svg" ALIGN=top WIDTH=650>
    </p>

    <p>The first stage is the Merge-Choice stage (MC), which takes a source configuration L and a key k<sub>1</sub> (the private choice key), picking the given amounts of elements from the sources and then shuffling them between each other. The second, Shuffle stage takes the resulting list of elements and a second key k<sub>2</sub> (the private shuffle key), performing a second shuffle on the list. This is done to ensure that multiple pairs of keys return the same funal pseudo-hash, and thus the user's particular pair is impossible to guess.</p>

    <p>
    The pshash function accepts the following inputs:
    <ul>
        <li>
            A <em>source configuration</em>, that is, a set of data that specifies what strings to pick characters from and how many to pick. There are predefined constants available under the keywords:

            <ul>
                <li> <em>long</em> (8 upper case, 8 lower case, 5 special characters, 4 digits). This is the default configuration. </li>
                <li> <em>medium</em> (5 symbols of each type) </li>
                <li> <em>short</em> (4 symbols of each type) </li>
                <li> <em>anlong</em> (7 upper case, 7 lower case, 7 digits) </li>
                <li> <em>anshort</em> (4 upper case, 4 lower case, 4 digits) </li>
                <li> <em>pin</em> (4-digit pin code) </li>
                <li> <em>mediumpin</em> (6-digit pin code) </li>
                <li> <em>longpin</em> (8-digit pin code) </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            A public key, i.e. a string of characters representing the website or service that requires the password.
            Examples include "google", "steam", "spotify", etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            A private <em>choice</em> key, a number between 0 and 10^42 (upper bound may depend on the source configuration).
        </li>
        <li>
            A private <em>shuffle</em> key, a number between 0 and 10^25 (upper bound may depend on the source configuration).
        </li>
    </ul>
